# Bob's Burgers

The website I will be creating for my Phase 2 project is called Bob's Burgers Wiki. I have been a huge fan of Bob's Burgers since college. I would like to make a website for the fans that can look up basic information for this show, infomation includes all the Bob's Burgers characters and a master list of all episodes from every season to date. 

The basic layout of the website is as follows:

HEADER
- Homepage
- Characters
    - Search Bar
- Episodes
    - Seasons
    - Episode lists
- Website Suggestion Box

API: "https://bobsburgers-api.herokuapp.com/"
Characters API: "https://bobsburgers-api.herokuapp.com/characters/"
Episodes API: "https://bobsburgers-api.herokuapp.com/episodes/"
